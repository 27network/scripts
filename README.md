# random scripts

## scripts

### rust.sh

Allows installing the Rust toolchain and components easily (by default, does so in your `sgoinfre`).

### ugdb.sh

Installs an alternative frontend for gdb that's subjectively better.

## coolutils.sh

Installs:
- `exa`, an `ls` alternative with colors & icons
- `bat`, a `cat` alternative with syntax-highlighting and built-in pager support
- `fd`, a multithreaded `find` alternative
- `rg` (ripgrep), a `grep` alternative that recursively searches and has a nicer default output
